<h3> New Authentication Android Application By Using 2 Factor. <br>
 >> Face Recognition And Google OTP <<
 
<h5> - This is Hybrid Application- <br>
  <h6> : Not only working on local device, But also connected with Django server. <br>
   <br> I knew that using Firebase was a more convenient module for implementing Google OTP. However, I thought it was more valuable and important to apply the skills I had learned at ENCORE over the past six months. So even if it is more difficult, it has been implemented by utilizing Mysql and Django. 
<br><br>
   And I wanted to make full use of the Android technology that I learned in my major in computer engineering to carry out a series of processes that serve not only the analysis but also the device through the server.
